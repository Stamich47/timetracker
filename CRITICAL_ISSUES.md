## ðŸ”§ Medium Priority Upgrades

### 4. Offline Functionality

- [ ] **Current Issue**: No offline support - app requires constant internet for Supabase connectivity
- [ ] **Impact**: App unusable without internet, data loss during connectivity issues
- [ ] **Technical Approach**: Hybrid offline-first architecture with Supabase
- [ ] **Solutions**:
  - [ ] **IndexedDB Local Storage**: Store time entries, projects, and user data locally
  - [ ] **Service Worker with Background Sync**: Queue API calls when offline, sync when reconnected
  - [ ] **Conflict Resolution**: Handle data conflicts when syncing (last-write-wins, user choice)
  - [ ] **Optimistic UI Updates**: Show changes immediately, sync in background
  - [ ] **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: App manifest, install prompt, offline caching
  - [ ] **Network Status Monitoring**: Detect online/offline state, show appropriate UI
- [ ] **Implementation Strategy**:
  - **Phase 1**: Basic offline storage (IndexedDB) for reading cached data
  - **Phase 2**: Write queue with background sync for offline actions
  - **Phase 3**: Conflict resolution and real-time sync when online
  - **Phase 4**: PWA features (install, push notifications)
- [ ] **Data Sync Architecture**:
  - Local IndexedDB as primary data source when offline
  - Supabase as source of truth when online
  - Bidirectional sync with conflict detection
  - User notifications for sync status and conflicts
- [ ] **Status**: Not Started
- [ ] **Priority**: High

### 5. Enhanced Error Handling & Recovery
