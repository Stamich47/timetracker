## ðŸš¨ High Priority Issues

### 1. Bundle Size & Performance Optimization

- [x] **Current Issue**: Main bundle is 283KB gzipped, PDF library adds 560KB
- [x] **Impact**: Slow loading times, poor mobile performance
- [x] **Solutions**:
  - [x] Code splitting for PDF generation (lazy load only when needed)
  - [x] Remove unused dependencies
  - [x] Implement dynamic imports for heavy components
  - [x] Bundle analysis and tree shaking optimization
- [x] **Status**: Completed - PDF functionality moved to separate lazy-loaded chunk (4.14KB vs 560KB in main bundle). Bundle analysis shows proper code splitting with main bundle remaining at 283KB.
- [x] **Priority**: Critical

- [x] **Impact**: Not usable for people with disabilities, potential legal issues
- [x] **Solutions**:
  - [x] Add ARIA labels to interactive elements
  - [x] Implement proper keyboard navigation
  - [x] Screen reader support
  - [x] Color contrast improvements
  - [x] Focus management for modals
  - [x] Keyboard shortcuts for common actions

- [x] **Priority**: Critical

### 3. Security Enhancements

- [ ] **Current Issue**: Input validation exists but could be more comprehensive
- [ ] **Impact**: XSS vulnerabilities, data injection risks
- [ ] **Solutions**:
  - [ ] Enhanced input sanitization
  - [ ] Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
  - [ ] CSRF protection
  - [ ] Secure authentication flows
  - [ ] Data validation on both client and server

## ðŸ”§ Medium Priority Upgrades

### 4. Offline Functionality

- [ ] **Current Issue**: No offline support - app requires constant internet for Supabase connectivity
- [ ] **Impact**: App unusable without internet, data loss during connectivity issues
- [ ] **Technical Approach**: Hybrid offline-first architecture with Supabase
- [ ] **Solutions**:
  - [ ] **IndexedDB Local Storage**: Store time entries, projects, and user data locally
  - [ ] **Service Worker with Background Sync**: Queue API calls when offline, sync when reconnected
  - [ ] **Conflict Resolution**: Handle data conflicts when syncing (last-write-wins, user choice)
  - [ ] **Optimistic UI Updates**: Show changes immediately, sync in background
  - [ ] **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: App manifest, install prompt, offline caching
  - [ ] **Network Status Monitoring**: Detect online/offline state, show appropriate UI
- [ ] **Implementation Strategy**:
  - **Phase 1**: Basic offline storage (IndexedDB) for reading cached data
  - **Phase 2**: Write queue with background sync for offline actions
  - **Phase 3**: Conflict resolution and real-time sync when online
  - **Phase 4**: PWA features (install, push notifications)
- [ ] **Data Sync Architecture**:
  - Local IndexedDB as primary data source when offline
  - Supabase as source of truth when online
  - Bidirectional sync with conflict detection
  - User notifications for sync status and conflicts
- [ ] **Status**: Not Started
- [ ] **Priority**: High

### 5. Enhanced Error Handling & Recovery

- [ ] **Current Issue**: Basic error handling exists but could be more robust
- [ ] **Impact**: Poor user experience during failures
- [ ] **Solutions**:
  - [ ] Global error boundaries with recovery options
  - [ ] Network status monitoring
  - [ ] Automatic retry mechanisms (partially implemented)
  - [ ] User-friendly error messages
- [ ] **Status**: Partially Complete (Retry logic implemented)
- [ ] **Priority**: High

### 6. Data Export/Import Improvements

- [ ] **Current Issue**: Basic export functionality exists
- [ ] **Impact**: Limited data portability and backup options
- [ ] **Solutions**:
  - [ ] Enhanced CSV/Excel export with more formats
