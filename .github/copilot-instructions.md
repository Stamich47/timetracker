# Time Tracker App - Copilot Instructions

This is a React TypeScript time tracking application similar to Clockify, built with:

- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite for fast development and building
- Tailwind CSS for professional, responsive styling
- Supabase for database storage and real-time features
- Lucide React for consistent iconography
- React Hook Form for efficient form handling
- Date-fns for date/time utilities

## Key Features to Implement:

- Time tracking with start/stop/pause functionality
- Project and client management
- Time entries with descriptions and tags
- Professional dashboard with analytics
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- Real-time data synchronization with Supabase

## Coding Standards:

- Use TypeScript for all components and utilities
- Follow React functional components with hooks
- Use Tailwind CSS classes for styling (no custom CSS unless necessary)
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Use consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components)
- Create reusable components where appropriate
- Implement proper accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

## Database Schema (Supabase):

- Users table for authentication
- Projects table with client information
- Time entries table linked to projects and users
- Tags table for categorizing time entries

Please prioritize clean, maintainable code with good TypeScript types and professional UI/UX design.
